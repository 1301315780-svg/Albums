        <h3>Whole Lotta Red was released on Christmas Day, December 25, 2020, following years of leaks, hype, and delays.
It was dropped without much traditional fanfare—more of an internet explosion of pent-up demand. The anticipation was so high after over two years of waiting since his last album, Die Lit, that the release itself became a major cultural moment online.</h3>
