    <h3>Jordan Terrell Carter, better known as Playboi Carti, is a rapper who basically went from being a kid obsessed with basketball and thrift-store fashion in Atlanta to becoming a huge cultural icon who defines a whole generation's sound and style.Born in 1996 in the Riverdale suburb of Atlanta, Jordan was an independent kid. In high school, his main goal was actually to be an NBA star; he idolized people like Allen Iverson. He even used to smoke before practice and still "drop 30" points, but after a fight with his coach, he quit the team and put all that competitive energy into music instead.He started rapping as "Sir Cartier" on SoundCloud around 2011, trying to figure things out. He was a "thrift store kid" who loved fashion, and while his unique style sometimes got him teased, it eventually became a huge part of his identity.The turning point came when he moved to New York City after high school to fully pursue music. While staying at a friend's/drug dealer's house, he ran into members of the A\(APMob[1.4.3].ThisledtoacrucialintroductiontoA\)AP Rocky, who saw his potential and helped him get signed to a major label deal with Interscope Records.From there, things moved fast. His 2017 self-titled mixtape blew up with hits like "Magnolia" and "Wokeuplikethis". His music is less about deep lyrics and more about creating a unique atmosphere with catchy ad-libs and a "baby voice" vocal style he pioneered.</h3>
